# Practicum Sprint 6 project
This is a basic exploration of some data on suicide rates and a few things that might affect them (for example, the number of working psychiatrists as a fraction of the population), using some basic Plotly graphs. If you want to see the app locally, you can clone this and install Streamlit and streamlit run app.py on whatever Python command line.

The app can be found at https://practicum-s6.onrender.com. And yes, I accidentally put this on the same repo I used for the thing earlier in the sprint....
